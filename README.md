A mobile Netflix clone built with Flutter, featuring a Beli-inspired film rating and ranking system. Users can browse movies and shows through a Netflix-style interface, then rate and rank titles directly within the same app. Animations with Lottie, and film/show data are fetched from the TMDB API.
